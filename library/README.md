# Wi-Fi Scan Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example shows how to scan for available set of APs.

## How to use example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-C3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.).
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming.

### Configure the project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`). 

In the `Example Configuration` menu:

* Set the Example configuration.
    * Use `Max size of scan list` to set the maximum nunber of access points in the list.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run the monitor tool to view the serial output:

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for all the steps to configure and use the ESP-IDF to build projects.
